# Maze Generator & Solver üß©

A Python-based maze generator and solver with real-time visualization using Tkinter. Watch as mazes are created using recursive backtracking and then solved using depth-first search algorithms.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Maze Generation** - Creates unique mazes using recursive backtracking DFS algorithm
- **Pathfinding Visualization** - Watch the solver explore the maze in real-time
- **Interactive Controls** - Adjustable maze size (5x5 to 50x50)
- **Real-Time Statistics** - Track generation steps, path length, and solving efficiency
- **Responsive Design** - Automatically resizes to fit window dimensions
- **Color-Coded Visualization**:
  - Purple: Start and end points
  - Blue: Explored cells during solving
  - Red: Final solution path
  - Black: Maze walls

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Installation

Run in Visual Studio Code
1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Select a Python interpreter (bottom-right)
3. Open `firstGen.py` and click "Run Python File in Terminal" or press F5 to debug


### Quick Start
1. Click "Generate Maze" to create a random maze
2. Choose a solver and click the appropriate button:
  - "Solve Maze using DFS" ‚Äî explores until it finds a path (first-found)
  - "Solve Maze using BFS" ‚Äî finds the shortest path in number of steps
3. Adjust the maze size and generate new mazes
4. Use "Reset" to clear the solution and try again

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Algorithms

**Maze Generation: Recursive Backtracking**
- Starts at a random cell and marks it as visited
- Randomly selects an unvisited neighbor and removes the wall between them
- Recursively visits the new cell
- Backtracks when no unvisited neighbors remain
- Creates perfect mazes with exactly one solution

**Pathfinding: Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Explores as far as possible along each branch
- Backtracks when hitting dead ends
- Guarantees finding a solution if one exists
- Visualizes the exploration process in real-time

**Pathfinding: Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- Finds the shortest path (in number of steps) on an unweighted grid
- Explores nodes by layers outward from the start until it reaches the end
- Implemented: BFS is available as an alternative solver in the app
- Useful when you want the shortest route rather than the first-found route

### Technologies
- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Tkinter** - GUI framework for visualization
- **Type Hints** - Enhanced code readability

### Code Highlights
- Object-oriented design with `MazeCell` and `MazeVisualizer` classes
- Type annotations for better code clarity
- Efficient wall representation using dictionaries
- Dynamic canvas resizing for responsive UI
- Real-time statistics tracking

##  Statistics Display

The app tracks and displays:
- **Generation Steps** - Total cells processed during maze creation
- **Path Length** - Number of cells in the solution path
- **Cells Explored** - Total cells visited during pathfinding
- **Efficiency** - Ratio of path length to cells explored (%)

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Additional solving algorithms (A*, Dijkstra)
- [ ] Different maze generation algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's)
- [ ] Export maze as image
- [ ] Save/load maze configurations
- [ ] Adjustable animation speed slider
- [ ] Compare multiple algorithms side-by-side
- [ ] 3D maze visualization
